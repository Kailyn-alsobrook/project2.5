  <div class="item1">History of alcoholism</div>
  <div class="item2a">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSMIV distinguished 
   two disorders involving alcohol;  alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence, both with specific criteria. 
   DSM5 combines the two DSMIV disorders, into a disorder called alcohol use disorder (AUD) with mild, 
   moderate, and severe sub-divisions. In the past, there was a large stigma that came with being an 
   alcoholic. This made the treatment for alcoholism inadequate because it was seen as more of a choice 
   than an addiction or disorder  </div>

  <div class="item3a">
   <div class="item3a">In 1944:
Marty Mann founds the National Committee for Education on Alcoholism (today the
National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence) around the following
propositions: <br>

 1.Alcoholism is a disease. <br>
2.The alcoholic, therefore, is a sick person. <br>
 3.The alcoholic can be helped.<br>
 4.The alcoholic is worth helping.<br>
 5.Alcoholism is our No. 4 public health problem, and our public responsibility.<br>

 <div class="item4a">Mann calls for a five-prong approach to be achieved by local NCEA affiliates:
<ul>
<li> Launching local public education campaigns on alcoholism.
 <li>Encouraging hospitals to admit alcoholics for acute detoxification.
<li>Establishing local alcohol information centers.
 <li>Establishing local clinics for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism.
 <li>Establishing "rest centers" for the long-term care of alcoholics. 
   </ul>
